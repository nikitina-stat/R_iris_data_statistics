## Iris Data Set Descriptive Statistics

### Project Overview
---

This project aims to create a table with descriptive statistics for the “Iris Flowers” dataset.

Requirements:

1.	Created table should be consistent with the template (reasonable deviations from layout are acceptable). Numbers in the table should be replaced with actual numbers based on data.


2.	Precision should be:
	
•	N – integer

•	Min, max – same precision as in dataset (1 decimal point)

•	Median, mean, standard deviation - +1 digit to data precision

• Percent should be rounded up to 1 digit after decimal point.


3. Table named “iris-flowers.txt” containing analysis described above

### Data Sources

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. 
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 

### Tools

R programming language.

Packages:

- tidyverse - data manipulation

- gtsummary - creating a table with descriptive statistics
